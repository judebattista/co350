In it's executive summary covering the future of work in America, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) posits that while the benefits of automation are too great to ignore, automation will also change and disrupt society. Focusing on localized economies, MGI found that most of America's job growth in the past century has been driven by only twenty-five economic centers. The remaining 290 cities and 2,000 rural counties ranged from impending economic collapse to modest growth. While thriving areas likely have the resilience to adapt to changing economic conditions, those areas already suffering may be irreversibly damaged by the upheaval as automata come of age.

As automation continues to grow, it will affect an increasing segment of the job market, displacing traditionally middle class jobs as well as the blue collar jobs already at risk. With American geographical mobility severely depressed, many displaced workers will be unable to relocate to less affected or more prosperous local economies. Thus, even as the job market may continue to grow overall, driven by health care, STEM fields, and business services, this will likely create substantial localized pockets of unemployment as lcoal populations with traditional skillset are incapable of adapting to the changing market. Struggling economies may also lack the wherewithall to offer retraining opportunities or invest in the growing sectors of the national job market.

Overcoming the difficulties of this technological sea change as a country will require careful but substantial action at both the national and local levels. With investment from and cooperation between the public and private sectors, America has the opportunity to emerge stronger and more capable than ever before.
